# Javachess

Java chess is a chess game implemented in Java. It is a practice project for a Computer Science course at University of Helsinki, by Arttu Kangas. The game will have at least normal chess against human or AI, and the games will be saved and can be rewatched.


### Documentation

__Current state__ of the project is that there is a runnable version that has main menu and a board showing (just one piece image so far). Clicking board will print in console which part of board was clicked. There is some code for generating potential moves for each piece, but that is not visible in application yet.

How to run it on linux with maven: <code>mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=javachess.Main</code>
