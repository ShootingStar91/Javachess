# Javachess requirement specification

### Purpose of the application

Javachess is a Java desktop application, which allows the user to play chess, against a human sitting next to them or alternatively against a simple AI.

The application will also save every game played on it into a database, and make it possible to re-watch these games turn-by-turn after they are finished.

The application does not have user roles. After each game the player can choose a name for the game to save it with in the database.

### Main functionalities

+ Play normal chess against human (Completed)
+ Play chess against a simple AI (Completed partly: Can be played, but the AI still virtually non-intelligent)
+ Re-watch games played in the past, going through them turn-by-turn (Completed)
  + Also possible to go backwards (Completed)

### Further development possibilities

These properties will only be implemented if there is extra time in the later weeks of the course.

+ Develop AI to a more complicated version
+ Make it possible to change AI settings and save them in database to use later
  + Make it possible to put two AI's play against each other and view the game
+ Display information about what the AI is thinking
  + This could mean a list of moves that the AI considers in the current situation
