# Instructions

Download [Javachess.jar](https://github.com/ShootingStar91/Javachess/releases/download/viikko7/Javachess.jar)

Run it on command line by:
```
java -jar Javachess.jar
```

Choose either Play Human or Play against AI.

Click the piece you want to move. Notice, that if there are no legal moves on the button you clicked, you will not be shown any moves - try a different piece until you find a move.

Notice that if you play against AI, the AI opponent will take some time to think. Depending of the pieces on board and your PC, it might last a bit longer. However, it is usually around 3-10 seconds.

Click on a shaded spot to move the piece there.

If your pawn reaches the last row of the board, you need to choose which piece to promote it into. The options will be shown at the top of the board.

When the game is finished, type a name for it and click OK (note: do not press enter).

Your game will be saved in javachessDatabase.db file in the same folder where you ran the game. This file is automatically created if it does not exist. If you want to remove all games, you can simply delete this file.

Click Rewatch games button to view your previous game and press the forward and backward buttons in the top of the screen.
